#assignment statements that:
# answer one adds 2 and assigns the result to b
# answer two multiplies b times 4 and assigns the result to b
# answer three divides a by 3.14 and assigns the result to b
# answer four  subtracts 8 from b and assigns the result to a

a = 0
b = a + 2
print("answer one is: ", b)

a = b * 4
print("answer two is: ", a)

b = a / 3.14
print("answer three is: ", b)

a = b - 8
print("answer four is: ", a)
